# MATLAB Frequency Response Analysis

This repository contains three MATLAB scripts for analyzing the frequency response of different electrical circuits. Each script is designed to calculate and plot the magnitude and phase response of the circuits over a specified frequency range.

## Script Descriptions

### Script 1: RLC Circuit Analysis

- **Purpose**: Analyze the frequency response of an RLC circuit with varying resistance values.
- **Features**:
  - Calculates the frequency response for resistances of 10K and 0.1K.
  - Plots the magnitude and phase response on a logarithmic scale.

### Script 2: Network Analysis Using Admittance Matrix

- **Purpose**: Determine the voltage across components in a network using the admittance matrix.
- **Features**:
  - Computes the absolute value and phase angle of the voltage across the third component.

### Script 3: Impedance Matrix Analysis

- **Purpose**: Calculate the current through components and voltage across a capacitor in a two-component network.
- **Features**:
  - Determines the absolute value and phase angle of the current through the first component and the voltage across the capacitor.

## Visualization

Each script generates plots to visualize the magnitude and phase response of the circuits. These plots are crucial for understanding the behavior of the circuits at different frequencies.

## Usage

To run the scripts, simply clone this repository and execute each script in MATLAB. Ensure that you have MATLAB installed on your system.
